System.in represents the keyboard

System.in provides access to raw bytes of data from the input device, which is the keyboard in our example. It is
the job of the InputStreamReader class to take those bytes and convert them into characters in your current character
set. System.in is passed to the InputStreamReader() constructor to create an InputStreamReader object.
InputStreamReader knows about characters, but not about lines. It is the BufferedReader classâ€™s job to detect
line breaks in the input stream, and to enable you to conveniently read a line at a time. BufferedReader also aids
efficiency by allowing physical reads from the input device to be done in different-size chunks than by which your
application consumes the data. This aspect can make a difference when the input stream is a large file rather than the
keyboard.
