== HTML styling

Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: 
. padding, 
. margin, and 
. border.

The four values available for padding and margin: -top, -right, -left and -bottom
These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce 
the exact same result as using the side-specific padding instructions.

CSS Styling.

Browsers read CSS from top to bottom. That means that, in the event of a conflict, 
the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last. Except an Id tag which takes precedence
over classes
