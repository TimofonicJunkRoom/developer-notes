Object oriented design principles

Open closed principle

The Open Close Principle states that the design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality 
should be added with minimum changes in the existing code. The design should be done in a 
way to allow the adding of new functionality as new classes, keeping as much as possible existing code unchanged.

Liskov substitution principle

Likov's Substitution Principle states that if a program module is using a Base class, then the reference 
to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.
Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.

favor composition over inheritance

Prefer composition over inheritance as it is more malleable / easy to modify later, but do not use a compose-always
approach. With composition, it's easy to change behavior on the fly with Dependency Injection / Setters. Inheritance
is more rigid as most languages do not allow you to derive from more than one type.. So the goose is more or less cooked
once you derive from Class A.

My acid test for the above is:

Does TypeB want to expose the complete interface (all public methods no less) of TypeA such that TypeB can be used
where TypeA is expected? Indicates Inheritance.
e.g. A Cessna biplane will expose the complete interface of an airplane, if not more. So that makes it fit 
to derive from Airplane.

Does TypeB only want only some/part of the behavior exposed by TypeA? Indicates need for Composition.
e.g. A Bird may need only the fly behavior of an Airplane. In this case, it makes sense to extract it out as
an interface / class / both and make it a member of both classes.

Update: Just came back to my answer and it seems now that it is incomplete without a specific mention of 
Barbara Liskov's Liskov Substitution Principle as a test for 'Should I be inheriting from this type?'

Single responsibility principle

A class should have only one reason to change.

Single-Responsibility-Principle is the basis of a good design.
If you have this principle in your mind while designing and developing, you will have a simpler more readable code.



Dependency inversion principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
