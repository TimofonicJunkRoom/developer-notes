Object oriented design principles

Open closed principle

The Open Close Principle states that the design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality 
should be added with minimum changes in the existing code. The design should be done in a 
way to allow the adding of new functionality as new classes, keeping as much as possible existing code unchanged.

Liskov substitution principle



favor composition over inheritance

Single responsibility principle

A class should have only one reason to change.

Dependency inversion principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
