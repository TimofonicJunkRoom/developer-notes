=== Functional Javascript

These are some steps one can take when writing code, usually this would be an iterative process 
during refactoring.

.Reduce functions dependence on shared state
.Use more readable language abstractions like forEach to iterate
.Use higher level abstractions like map to reduce the amount of code
.Reduce functions to their simplest forms
.Delete code until it stops working

These steps are explained in greater detail with examples in the following article
