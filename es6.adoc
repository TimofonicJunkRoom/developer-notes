=== Using Let as oppose to var
    . Prefer const. You can use it for all variables whose values never change.
    . Otherwise, use let â€“ for variables whose values do change. 
    . Avoid var.
    
    
=== For .. of loop.

If you want both index and value of each array element, for-of has got you covered, too, via the new Array method entries() and destructuring:

```code js
for (const [index, elem] of arr.entries()) {
    console.log(index+'. '+elem);
}

```

ES6 Spread operator

# turns an Array into their seperate values.

A good example is the Math.max function which expects sperate values and not an array.
