Mini tip! You might notice the URL change when you open/close differnet code panels. 
There are four numbers, and stand for HTML, CSS, JS, and Console (in that order). So the URL parameter:

?editors=0011

Stands for HTML closed, CSS closed, JavaScript open, Console open. Passing a 2 
as the last number maximizes the console. In this way you could share a Pen 
where the output is intentionally only for the console.
