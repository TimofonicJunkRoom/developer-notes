== Scala First steps
-- 

This document describes in fairly generic terms the steps required to get up and running with a scala project in Vim.

1. Install JDK 7+
2. Install Scala compiler
3. Install SBT (Scala build tool)
4. Add ScalaTest and Scalactic support

. Create a blank directory for your project files
`vim build.sbt` in base directory follow http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Hello.html[sbt setup]
. use https://gist.github.com/alvinj/3194379[Alvin Alexanders] shell script to make sbt project directory
. Open two terminal sessions in tabs. (CTRL-PgUP to toggle). First terminal session run Vim with NerdTree and second 
session run sbt with `~compile` command to constantly compile src files or alternatively `~test`
