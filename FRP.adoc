== Functional reactive programming

=== Effectively using actors
Configuring thread pools is a task best delegated to Akka, simply configure in the application.conf file.

===== Summary: actorOf vs. actorSelection vs. actorFor

Note: What the above sections described in some detail can be summarized and memorized easily as follows:

***

1. *actorOf* only ever creates a new actor, and it creates it as a direct child of the context on which this method
is invoked (which may be any actor or actor system).
2. *actorSelection* only ever looks up existing actors when messages are delivered, i.e. does not create
actors, or verify existence of actors when the selection is created.
3. *actorFor* (deprecated in favor of *actorSelection*) only ever looks up an existing actor, i.e. does not create
one.


== Thunk
A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.
