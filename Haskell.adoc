Haskell is a purely functional programming language. 

Recusrion in Haskell.

### Recursive definition of length. 

length :: [a] -> Int
length [] = 0                  # the base case
length (x:xs) = 1 + length xs  # recursion case

### Recursive definition of filter.

filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter pred []    = []
filter pred (x:xs)
  | pred x         = x : filter pred xs
  | otherwise      = filter pred xs
  
### Recursive definition of map

map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
