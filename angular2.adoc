. Properties and Events

*Event bindings*, which can be added using the *() syntax*, can be used to capture 
a browser event execute some function on a component. So they trigger the first phase.

*Property bindings*, which can be added using the *[] syntax*, should be used only 
for reflecting the state of the model in the view.
