=== CSS

When using Precss in the postcss always adhere to the convention of naming your
css files with an _underscore, i.e. _base.css. This ensures your css files are treated as
modules by the postcss compiler.

1rem is usually equal to about 16px

To get a good sizing ratio set a css element
`
html {
  font-size: 62.5% # comment - this ensures your 1 rem = 10px and setting a 1.8rem means its 18px

}
`
