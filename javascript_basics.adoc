  In a date object the month is always zero based
  
  Use getFullYear instead of getYear
  
  If you need to compare two dates use the Date.getTime() function to ensure you compare
  the millisecond values, as oppose to comparing the Date objects which would be different references.
  
  The innerHtml method on the document object can be useful to get the text content
  from simple DOM elements (h1, p tags). For Div tags you can get more than just text.
  
  var myElem = document.createElement("li") // or p or div tags or whatever 
  
  Creates the element in space 
  
  then you need to add it to the DOM, or insert it.
  
  myUl.appendChild(myElem);
  
  then createTextNode and appendChild to myElem.
  
  Event handler and event listener is the same
