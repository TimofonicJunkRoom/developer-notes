== Top tips for using Scala effectively.

=== HASHCODE AND EQUALS SHOULD ALWAYS BE PAIRED 
The equals and hashCode methods should always be implemented such that if x == y then x.## == y.##.

Stick to the following constraints when implementing equality:

.If two objects are equal, they should have the same hashCode.
.A hashCode computed for an object wonâ€™t change for the life of the object.
.When sending an object to another JVM, equality should be determined using
attributes available in both JVMs.
.Utilize only immutable object internal state in hashCode computation
.Use default concepts for equals and hashCode

As you can see, this means that something in the object must be immutable. Making the entire object immutable simplifies this whole process greatly.
