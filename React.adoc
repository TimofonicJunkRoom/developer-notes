### React

. https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/[React Base fiddle (jsx)]


Always try to use stateless components and write idiomatic React. Be a pragmatic 
programmer: go for stateless components where possible, but state is there to 
be used when you really need it.

``` code

const FunctionalTest = (props) => {
    return {props.message};
};

```


=== Why the parens within the render function / method.

Why do we need the parentheses around the return statement? 
This is because of JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion. 
Without the parentheses, JavaScript would ignore the following lines and 
return without a value. If the JSX starts on the same line as the return, 
then parentheses are not needed.
