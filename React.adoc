### React

. https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/[React Base fiddle (jsx)]


Always try to use stateless components and write idiomatic React. Be a pragmatic 
programmer: go for stateless components where possible, but state is there to 
be used when you really need it.

``` code

const FunctionalTest = (props) => {
    return {props.message};
};

```
