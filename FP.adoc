== Functional programming

=== Monads
A monad is a way to structure computations in terms of values and sequences of computations using those values. 
Monads allow the programmer to build up computations using sequential building blocks, which can themselves be
sequences of computations. The monad determines how combined computations form a new computation and frees 
the programmer from having to code the combination manually each time it is required.
